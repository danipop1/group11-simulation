# Evaluation Metrics

The Evaluation Metrics section provides clear criteria for assessing participant performance in the Salt Typhoon simulation. It measures both success in handling the scenario and effectiveness of teamwork across four key categories:

1. Threat Identification and Response  
2. Interdisciplinary Collaboration and Stakeholder Coordination  
3. Legal, Regulatory, and Policy Compliance  
4. Ethical Reasoning and Decision-Making

## Threat Identification and Response

Measures the team’s ability to detect cybersecurity threats quickly and accurately, and to prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity.

**Evaluation Guidelines (scale of 1–5):**
- **1 – Poor**  
  Fails to identify critical threats and mismanages response priorities.
- **2 – Needs Improvement**  
  Major threats are missed; response is slow or improperly prioritized.
- **3 – Satisfactory**  
  Some threats are missed; response prioritization is inconsistent.
- **4 – Good**  
  Most threats are identified in a timely manner; responses are appropriate but could be better prioritized.
- **5 – Outstanding**  
  Threats are identified rapidly with clear justification for prioritization; demonstrates proactive threat hunting.

## Interdisciplinary Collaboration and Stakeholder Coordination

Measures effectiveness of communication among roles and integration of stakeholder perspectives into strategy.

**Evaluation Guidelines (scale of 1–5):**
- **1 – Poor**

- **2 – Needs Improvement**  
  Frequent miscommunication; major stakeholder views are ignored.
- **3 – Satisfactory**

  Significant misunderstandings of legal obligations.

**Evaluation Guidelines (scale of 1–5):**
- **1 – Poor**  
  Decisions are ethically problematic or reckless.
- **2 – Needs Improvement**  
  Ethical concerns are overlooked.
- **3 – Satisfactory**  
  Ethical standards are applied inconsistently.
