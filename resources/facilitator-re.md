# Facilitator Resources

This page provides guidance and best practices for facilitators running the Salt Typhoon Cybersecurity Breach simulation.

## 1. Facilitator Role Overview
As facilitator, you will:
- **Introduce** the simulation context, objectives, and deliverables  
- **Assign** and explain participant roles  
- **Administer** each phase by distributing materials and collecting outputs  
- **Track** team progress using the defined evaluation metrics  
- **Guide** without giving away solutions, encouraging internal problem-solving

## 2. Introducing the Simulation
1. **Overview & Objectives**  
   - Brief participants on “Salt Typhoon”  
   - Emphasize goals:  
     - Assess reaction strategies  
     - Uncover security gaps  
     - Simulate progressive threats  
     - Strengthen interdepartmental cooperation  
     - Refine crisis response capabilities  
2. **Role Assignment**  
   - Distribute roles (Incident Response Coordinator, Network Security Specialist, Malware Analyst, Data Privacy Officer)  
   - Clarify each role’s responsibilities and deliverables  
3. **Phase Structure**  
   - Explain the four phases and their outputs:  
     1. Threat Assessment  
     2. Containment Plan  
     3. Crisis Communication Plan  
     4. Resilience Strategy  
   - Confirm timelines and methods for submission

## 3. Handling Participant Questions
- Act as a **neutral guide**  
- **Prompt** participants with leading questions rather than solutions  
- Encourage teams to **collaborate internally** before seeking facilitator input  
- Maintain the **flow** of the exercise, ensuring on-time progression through phases

## 4. Providing & Injecting Additional Information
- Use **injects** to simulate real-world unpredictability and pressure:  
  - Media leaks or breaking news  
  - Policy or regulatory updates  
  - New technical findings or vulnerabilities  
- **Timing & Purpose**  
  - Schedule injects to highlight potential blind spots  
  - Trigger critical discussions (technical, legal, ethical, strategic)  
  - Reinforce learning objectives and maintain engagement  
- **Delivery Methods**  
  - Email announcements  
  - Printed or slide-deck handouts  
  - Live “breaking news” bulletin

## 5. Quick-Start Checklist
- [ ] Prep participant materials for all four phases  
- [ ] Upload inject documents & schedule delivery times  
- [ ] Review evaluation metrics and scoring rubric  
- [ ] Confirm PDF/manual links on the website  
- [ ] Test site navigation and download links
