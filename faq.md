**Q1: How do injects work?**  
Injects are surprise scenario updates (e.g., media leaks, new vulnerabilities) introduced by the facilitator.

**Q2: Can we swap roles mid-simulation?**  
Only if your facilitator approves; consistency helps maintain realism.

**Q3: What if technical issues arise?**  
Notify the facilitator immediately; technical support resources are on standby.

**Q4: How is performance scored?**  
See [Evaluation Metrics](/evaluation-metrics.html). Late deliverables incur penalties.
