Listed below are frequently asked questions pertaining to the simulation and any potential issues encountered over the course of the simulation.


**1. What is the main objective of the “Salt Typhoon” simulation?**
The simulation is designed to test and improve your organization’s ability to respond to a major cybersecurity breach. It emphasizes real-time decision-making, cross-functional collaboration, and resilience under pressure.
**2. How are roles assigned, and can participants switch roles?**
Roles are assigned by the facilitator based on group size and expertise. While role-switching is not encouraged mid-simulation, accommodations can be made in smaller groups or due to participant absence.
**3. What should I do if I don’t understand my role or responsibilities?**
Refer to the role descriptions in the manual. If clarification is needed, ask the facilitator — they can guide you without solving the problem for you.
**4. What are “injects” and how do they affect the simulation?**
Injects are surprise updates (e.g., news reports, new regulations, system failures) introduced by the facilitator to simulate the unpredictability of a real-world breach. They add complexity and challenge your team’s adaptability and decision-making.
**5. Can we ask the facilitator for advice during the simulation?**
Yes, but facilitators will not give direct solutions. Instead, they will prompt you to think critically and guide your team through structured problem-solving.
**6. How is our performance evaluated?**
Performance is scored across four categories:
Threat Identification and Response
Interdisciplinary Collaboration and Stakeholder Coordination
Legal, Regulatory, and Policy Compliance
Ethical Reasoning and Decision-Making
Each is rated on a 1–5 scale, with detailed rubrics provided in the manual.
**7. What happens if we miss a phase deadline?**
Missing a deadline will impact your evaluation. The simulation is structured to reflect time pressure in real-world scenarios, so staying on track is crucial for success.
**8. What if there’s a technical or logistical issue during the exercise?**
Immediately notify the facilitator. They will resolve the issue or adapt the simulation timeline as needed to ensure continuity.
**9. How realistic is the scenario?**
The scenario is modeled after real-world cybersecurity threats and breaches. While fictional, it mirrors actual attack vectors, regulatory challenges, and public relations crises.
