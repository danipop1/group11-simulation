## Background of the Salt Typhoon Attack

On December 4, 2024, a top U.S. security agency confirmed that foreign state-sponsored actors—linked to the People’s Republic of China—breached at least eight U.S. telecommunications companies, compromising sensitive network infrastructure as part of a wider espionage campaign affecting dozens of countries. The incident, dubbed **Salt Typhoon**, revealed critical vulnerabilities in our communications backbone and underscored the need for stronger, enforceable cybersecurity standards :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

In direct response, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposed clarifications to Section 105 of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), making it a legal requirement for carriers not only to secure equipment but also to maintain and certify robust cybersecurity risk-management plans. The FCC also floated an annual certification framework to hold providers accountable for implementing these plans :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

Because telecommunications networks underpin national security, public safety, and economic resilience, Salt Typhoon serves as a stark reminder that proactive, well-governed defenses are essential to staying ahead of evolving cyber threats :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.
