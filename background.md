## Background of the Salt Typhoon Attack

On December 4, 2024, state-sponsored actors linked to the People’s Republic of China breached at least eight U.S. telecommunications providers, compromising critical network infrastructure as part of a widescale espionage campaign affecting dozens of countries.^[1] In direct response, the Federal Communications Commission clarified Section 105 of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), requiring carriers to maintain certified cybersecurity risk-management plans and proposing an annual compliance certification.^[1]

Because telecommunications networks underpin national security, public safety, and economic stability, **Salt Typhoon** is a stark reminder that proactive, well-governed defenses are essential to staying ahead of evolving cyber threats.
